<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Assignment</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="10">1. Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?<br>
a. How did you unit test it?<br>
-&gt; using ByteArrayOutputStream for test system.out.println<br>
b. How did you optimize the code for maintainability?<br>
(Ask yourself the same question for all following exercises)<br>
-&gt; Should use interface for action method and make it on new package or new class, group by something</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="17">Now, we have 2 special kinds of birds: the Duck and the Chicken… Can you implement them to make their own special sound?<br>
a. A duck says: “Quack, quack” -&gt; YES<br>
b. A duck can swim -&gt;YES<br>
c. A chicken says: “Cluck, cluck”  -&gt; YES<br>
d. A chicken cannot fly (assumption: its wings are clipped but ignore that) -&gt;YES</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="22">Now how would you model a rooster?<br>
a. A rooster says: “Cock-a-doodle-doo” -&gt; YES<br>
b. How is the rooster related to the chicken? -&gt; Rooster is children of Chicken<br>
c. Can you think of other ways to model a rooster without using inheritance? -&gt; we are using interface toimplement action Rooster need, so dont need using inheritance</p>
